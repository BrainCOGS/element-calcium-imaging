# DataJoint Element - Functional Calcium Imaging

+ This repository features DataJoint pipeline design for functional Calcium imaging 
with `ScanImage`, `Scanbox`, or `Nikon NIS` acquisition system and `Suite2p` or `CaImAn` suites for analysis.

+ The pipeline presented here is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular
design of tables and dependencies specific to the functional Calcium imaging workflow. This
modular element can be flexibly attached downstream to any particular design of experiment
session, thus assembling a fully functional calcium imaging workflow (see the
example [workflow-calcium-imaging](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-calcium-imaging)).

+ For more information on this Element and others, please visit our
[Element Functional Calcium Imaging docs](datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-calcium-imaging).
